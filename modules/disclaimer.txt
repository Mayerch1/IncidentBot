**__An example of how we would preferably see reports:__**

**-__ONE__ incident per report!**
**-No footage from the reporting driver, no incident to judge**
-Provide a bit of lead-in (10s or so) so we can understand the situation.
-Both drivers' chase cams should be **mandatory**.
-If it is an ACC/iRacing clip, turn the pedal inputs hud on. If it is another game, provide 1st person so we can see the rev counter instead.
-Beyond that, additional PoVs are welcome if you think they help us better understand the incident.

Plenty little details help us better judge an incident, but image quality is crucial, so please stop with the phone recordings, as that only makes our job harder.
Your GPUs have internal recording software and the OS comes with Windows Video Editor for basic cutting and pasting of clips.
We prefer youtube uploads since it gives us playback speed control, but Streamable is fine.

Thank you for cooperating. :slight_smile:
